This Laravel package adds multi-theme support to your application. It also provides a simple authentication scaffolding for a starting point for building a Laravel application. And it also has preset for  `Bootstrap`, `Tailwind`, `Vue`, and `React`. So, I believe it is a good alternative to the `laravel/ui` & `laravel/breeze` package.

## Features
- Any number of themes
- Fallback theme support (WordPress style); It allows creating a child theme to extend any theme
- Provides authentication scaffolding similar to `laravel/ui` & `laravel/breeze`
- Exports all auth controllers, tests, and other files similar to `laravel/breeze`
- Provides frontend presets for `Bootstrap`, `Tailwind`, `Vue 2`, `Vue 3` and `React`

If you don't want to use auth scaffolding of this package, instead you want to
use Laravel Fortify, no problem with that. You can use Laravel Themer with
Fortify.  Laravel Fortify only gives backend implementation authentication, it
does not provide views or frontend presets. So, use Fortify for backend auth and
Laravel Themer for views and presets.

## Tutorial
Here is the video for **[Laravel Themer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ty4ZwFTLYXE)**.

## Installation and setup

You can install this package via composer using:
```bash
composer require qirolab/laravel-themer
```

Publish a configuration file:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Qirolab\Theme\ThemeServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Creating a theme

Run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
php artisan make:theme
```

This command will ask you to enter theme name, CSS framework, js framework, and optional auth scaffolding.

## Useful Theme methods:

```php
// Set active theme
Theme::set('theme-name');

// Get current active theme
Theme::active();

// Get current parent theme
Theme::parent();

// Clear theme. So, no theme will be active
Theme::clear();

// Get theme path
Theme::path($path = 'views');
// output:
// /app-root-path/themes/active-theme/views

Theme::path($path = 'views', $themeName = 'admin');
// output:
// /app-root-path/themes/admin/views

Theme::getViewPaths();
// Output:
// [
//     '/app-root-path/themes/admin/views',
//     '/app-root-path/resources/views'
// ]

```

## Middleware to set a theme
Register `ThemeMiddleware` in `app\Http\Kernel.php`:

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'theme' => \Qirolab\Theme\Middleware\ThemeMiddleware::class,
];
```
Examples for middleware usage:
```php
// Example 1: set theme for a route
Route::get('/dashboard', 'DashboardController@index')
    ->middleware('theme:dashboard-theme');


// Example 2: set theme for a route-group
Route::group(['middleware'=>'theme:admin-theme'], function() {
    // "admin-theme" will be applied to all routes defined here
});


// Example 3: set child and parent theme
Route::get('/dashboard', 'DashboardController@index')
    ->middleware('theme:child-theme,parent-theme');
```

## Asset compilation
 To compile the theme assets, you need to add the theme's `webpack.mix.js` in
 the root `webpack.mix.js`.

```js
// add this in the root `webpack.mix.js`
require(`${__dirname}/themes/theme-name/webpack.mix.js`);
```
Now you can run the `npm install` and `npm run dev` command to compile theme assets.

If you add multiple `webpack.mix.js` of different themes in the root `webpack.mix.js`, then `webpack` may not compile these correctly. So, you should modify the root `webpack.mix.js` with the following code:
```js
let theme = process.env.npm_config_theme;

if(theme) {
   require(`${__dirname}/themes/${theme}/webpack.mix.js`);
} else {
    // default theme to compile if theme is not specified
  require(`${__dirname}/themes/theme-name/webpack.mix.js`);
}
```

Now, to compile a particular theme run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev --theme=theme-name

# or

npm run watch --theme=theme-name

# or

npm run production --theme=theme-name
```
